# 2019_personal_plan
Inspired by 2014 year plan in my repo. The content is important, while I will move them to my blog later.


Goal:
1. CFA level 1
2. Summarize the code kits during my working experience
3. Summarize the books I read
4. Others doesn' matter:

	4.1 Collection the world's na mi na mi na (something can not be expressed)
	
	4.2 Blog
