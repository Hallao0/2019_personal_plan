# 2019_personal_plan
Inspired by 2014 year plan in my repo. The content is important, while I will move them to my blog later.


Goal:
1. CFA level 1
	measured by grades
2. Summarize the code kits during my working experience
	measured by response from my boss ?? no, measured by my own standard: code efficiency, stability, conditions handle( Ma Kun's overloads story)
3. Summarize the books I read
	measured by reading number perhaps (I can uploads articles in Douban or Wechat public number)
4. Others doesn' matter:

	4.1 Collection the world's na mi na mi na (something can not be expressed)
	
	4.2 Build my body
	
	4.3 Blog
	
	

p.s Measure construct a feedback system, to improve better.
